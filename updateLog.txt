Update V1.00:
    Back End
    -----------
    - Changed old variable names to newer and related names (e.g from passwordLength to amountOfGB)
    - Changed some interger data types to float to allow decimal points to work
    - Changed inputs from passwordGenerator fork to better suit the purpose of the program
    - Fixed an error when entering a decimal number which didn't accept that input
